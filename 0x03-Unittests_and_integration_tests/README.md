0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

Learning Objectives

The difference between unit and integration tests.
Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

Requirements

1. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
6. All your files must be executable
7. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
8. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
9. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
10. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
11. All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
